Feature: Merge Articles
  As a blog administrator
  In order to collect articles with the same topic in one place
  I want to able to merge content, comment of two same topic articles

  Background:
  
  Scenario: A none-admin cannot merge articles

  Scenario: When articles are merged, the merged article should contain the text of both previous articles
  
  Scenario: When articles are merged, the merged article should have one author (either one of the authors of the original article)

  Scenario: Comments on each of the two original articles need to call carry over and point to the new, merged article

  Scenario: The title of the new article should be the title from either one of the merged articles
